{"id":"cheatsheet-88j","title":"Implement Merchant Copy pixel font rendering for PNG generation","description":"Implement simplified PNG generation using bitmap pixel fonts (Merchant Copy). The layout is already done in txt files (cheatsheet-mpk), so this script just needs to: 1) Read pre-laid-out .txt files, 2) Render each character using the bitmap font, 3) Apply 1-bit threshold. No layout calculations or text wrapping needed. This makes the pipeline much simpler and guarantees crisp pixel-perfect output.
